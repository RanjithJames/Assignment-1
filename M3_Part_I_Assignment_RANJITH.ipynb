        "Summary\n",
        "Classification is one of the most important tasks of NLP and in machine learning. In NLP it often means the task of text categorization for both sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic modeling. Naïve Bayes is often one of the first classification algorithms defined in NLP.  The intuition behind a classifier is lies at the underlying probability inferred by the Bayesian Inference, which uses Baye’s rule and conditional probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s a reminder on Baye’s Rule:\n",
        "P(y)=P(x)P(x)/(P(y))\n",
        "\n",
        "We are saying “what is the probability of x given y”. Naïve Bayes is a generative model because there is an input that helps the model determine what the output could be. Said differently, “to train a generative model we first collect a large amount of data in some domain (e.g., think millions of images, sentences, or sounds, etc.) and then train a model to generate data like it.” [6]\n",
        "\n",
        "So in the case of Naïve Bayes, we say given some word, what should be the class of the current word we are assessing? Contrastingly, discriminative models such as logistic regression, learn from features provided to the algorithm and then determine or predict what the class is. [7]\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "With Naïve Bayes, the assumption is that the probabilities are independent. We often call the Naïve Bayes classifier the bag-of-words approach. That’s because we are essentially throwing in the collection of words into a ‘bag’, selecting a word at random, and then calculating their frequency to use in the Bayesian Inference. Thus, context – the position of words -- is ignored and despite this, it turns out that the Naïve Bayes approach can be accurate and effective at determining whether an email is spam for example.\n",
        "\n",
        "Back to bag of words. With bag of words, we assume that the position of the words are not relevant -- that dependency or context in the word phrase or sentence doesn’t matter. Relatedly, the naive Bayes assumption implies that the conditional probabilities are independent -- a rather strange assumption to make for words in a sentence! The equation for the naive Bayes classifier is outlined below:\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use Naive Bayes by creating an index of words and walking through every word position in a test or corpus.\n"
